# StitchOS — Overview

**Brand:** StitchOS — The Connected Loom  
**Tagline:** Real-time RFID tracking for textiles.

**One-line pitch:** A SaaS + IoT platform that gives garment factories real-time visibility of bundles, uniforms, and inventory using UHF RFID—from floor to warehouse to laundry.

**About:** StitchOS connects the factory floor with an RFID-first data backbone. We ingest reads from fixed portals and handhelds, apply rules, and expose clean events, KPIs, and audit trails to teams.

**Mission:** Make textile operations visible, predictable, and fair—through simple, secure, real-time software.

**Vision:** A connected loom for every factory: live data, zero guesswork.
