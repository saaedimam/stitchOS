      <p><strong>Brand:</strong> StitchOS — The Connected Loom</p>
      <p><strong>Tagline:</strong> Real-time RFID tracking for textiles.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>One-line pitch:</strong> A SaaS + IoT platform that gives garment
        factories real-time visibility of bundles, uniforms, and inventory using
        UHF RFID—from floor to warehouse to laundry.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>About:</strong> StitchOS connects the factory floor with an
        RFID-first data backbone. We ingest reads from fixed portals and
        handhelds, apply rules, and expose clean events, KPIs, and audit trails
        to teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mission:</strong> Make textile operations visible, predictable,
        and fair—through simple, secure, real-time software.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Vision:</strong> A connected loom for every factory: live data,
        zero guesswork.
